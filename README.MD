---

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**

- React, React Router
- Bootstrap, custom CSS (holiday theme)

**Backend**

- Express + Node.js
- Socket.IO for live updates
- Python bridge for ComfyUI

**AI & Cloud**

- DeepSeek GPT for poems + flux prompts
- ComfyUI for image generation
- AWS S3 for output storage

---

## Architecture (High Level)

- React client submits a wish to the Express API
- Server triggers ComfyUI workflow and streams progress via Socket.IO
- Outputs are uploaded to S3 and returned to the client as URLs
- Poem is generated via the DeepSeek LLM API and delivered in real time

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- ComfyUI
- Python 3.x (for ComfyUI)

## Model Files (Hugging Face)

Sloomoo uses ComfyUI for image generation. To run it locally, you need to download the required model files (UNet, text encoders, VAE, and optional LoRA).
They are hosted on Hugging Face so you can download them in your browser.

### Download (Browser / GUI)

1. Open the Hugging Face repo (model assets): [link here](https://huggingface.co/thelunos/sloomoo_comfyui_assets)
2. Read the model card for the exact folder paths for each file type(vae, text_encoders, loras, diffusion_models)
3. Click the Files tab and download the required assets.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sloomoo.git
cd sloomoo
```

### 2. Run the client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Run the server

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Run ComfyUI

In your root Comfy directory

```bash
source venv/bin/activate #macOS/Linux
python main.py
```

### 5. Visit in Browser

Open http://localhost:3000
to start your journey

## Troubleshooting

- If generation never starts, confirm ComfyUI is running and the server’s ComfyUI endpoint/path matches your setup.
- If images don’t appear, verify AWS credentials + bucket permissions and that AWS_REGION is correct.
- If the client can’t connect, check REACT_APP_SERVER_URL and CORS/FRONTEND_URL.

## Environment Variables

### Client (client/.env)

```bash
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Server (server/.env)

```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
AWS_REGION=your_region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
```
